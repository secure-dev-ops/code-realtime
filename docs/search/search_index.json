Both capsules and classes can have template parameters.

In the early 1990s the Canadian company ObjecTime Limited developed a language called ROOM to address the challenges of building realtime applications consisting of communicating state machines. ROOM introduced concepts such as capsules, protocols and ports and was first implemented in the tool ObjecTime Developer. This tool got adopted in a wide range of industrial domains for example telecom and embedded systems development.</p> <p>In 2000 ObjectTime was acquired by Rational Software and ObjecTime Developer was merged with Rational Rose, a UML modeling tool. The result was Rational Rose RealTime (Rose RT). At the same time many of the ROOM language concepts made its way into the, by then, new modeling language called UML-RealTime.</p> <p>In 2003 Rational Software was acquired by IBM which at the time was investing heavily in the Eclipse platform. As a result work started to create an Eclipse-based tool as the successor of Rose RT. This new product got the name Rational Software Architect RealTime Edition (RSARTE) and was first released in 2007.</p> <p>In 2016 HCL entered a partnership with IBM, which led to a rebranded version of RSARTE called HCL RTist. A few years later both RSARTE and RTist were renamed to DevOps Model RealTime.</p> <p>Work on Code RealTime began in 2020 with the aim of supporting other IDEs than Eclipse. As part of this effort a textual language syntax, Art, was developed. Hence it's fair to describe the Art language as a new syntax for concepts that have a rather old history and have already been used in the industry for more than 30 years. It should also be mentioned that the Target RunTime System used in Code RealTime is the same as is used in Model RealTime.

For example, the rule configuration <code>X0003,I0004,W0009,E0005</code> means the following:</p> <ul> <li>The rule ART_0003_nameShouldStartWithUpperCase is disabled</li> <li>The rule ART_0004_nameShouldStartWithLowerCase has its severity set to Information</li> <li>The rule ART_0009_invalidProperty has its severity set to Warning</li> <li>The rule ART_0005_choiceWithoutElseTransition has its severity set to Error</li> </ul> <p>To configure validation rules globally, use the configuration setting <code>code-rt.validation.ruleConfiguration</code>. A global configuration will apply for all Art files in the workspace, and all Art elements within those files, unless a local rule configuration has been set on an element.</p> <p>To configure validation rules locally, set the property rule_config on an Art element. It will affect the validation of that Art element itself, as well as all elements contained within that Art element.

By stateful we mean that the application consists of objects whose behavior can be described with state machines. By event-driven we mean that these objects communicate with each other by sending events, which can cause their state machines to transition from one state to another when received. </p> <p>The Art language provides high-level concepts not directly found in the C++ language. All these high-level concepts are transformed into C++ code by the Art compiler. Generated code uses a run-time library known as the TargetRTS (Target RunTime System). The TargetRTS is a C++ library that acts as a layer between the generated code and the underlying platform (hardware, operating system etc) on which the realtime application runs. </p> <p></p> <p>Art is well suited for describing both the behavior and structure of a realtime application, but it uses C++ as expression and action language. C++ is also used for declaring types, variables, functions etc. As a rule of thumb, Art uses C++ for everything where C++ is a good fit, and only provides new language concepts where no appropriate constructs exist in C++. This means that if you already know C++, you can quickly learn Art too, and existing C++ code you have already written can be used in your Art application.</p> <p>Note that the translation of Art to C++ also involves analysis of the C++ code that is present in the Art files. The code generator supports certain C++ extensions in such embedded C++ code and will \"expand\" them to C++ code as part of code generation for an Art file.</p>"},{"location":"art-lang/#concepts-and-terminology","title":"Concepts and Terminology","text":"<p>In Art the concept of a capsule is central. A capsule is like a C++ class, but with a few differences and extensions. A C++ class is passive in the sense that a caller can access its public member functions and variables at any time. Hence a C++ object always executes in the context of the caller, and when a member function is called, the caller is blocked until the function call returns. A capsule, however, is active and has its own execution context. This means that we never call a capsule member function or access a capsule member variable from outside the capsule itself. Instead we communicate with the capsule by sending events to it. Each capsule instance has a queue of events it has received and those events will be dispatched to the capsule instance one by one. The sender of the event is not blocked, as the event will be handled by the capsule instance asynchronously when it is later dispatched.</p> <p>The picture below shows 3 capsule instances each holding a queue with events that have been received, but not yet dispatched. Note that this picture is conceptual. In a real implementation several performance optimizations are applied, for example it's common to let a single thread drive more than one capsule instance, and several capsule instances can share a common event queue. But from a conceptual point of view each capsule instance has its own queue of events that are waiting to be dispatched to it. Events have a priority which determines how they are ordered in the queue. Events with high priority are placed before events with lower priority, and if two events have the same priority they are ordered according to when they arrive.</p> <p></p> <p>A capsule may have ports. A port is typed by a protocol which defines the events that may be sent in to the port (these are known as in-events), as well as the events the capsule itself may send out through the port for others to receive (these are called out-events). Ports can be used both for internal and external communication. A port used for external communication is called a service port. Together, the service ports constitute the communication interface of the capsule, and decide what \"services\" the capsule provides for other capsules to use.</p> <p></p> <p>A simple capsule which only handles a small number of events, may be able to handle all these events using a single state machine. However, when new ports are added (or new events in protocols typing existing ports), the capsule interface grows and the state machine has to grow with it, since there will be more events for it to handle. Eventually a point is reached where it will not be practical for a capsule to handle any more events in its own state machine, because it has grown too large or complex. If not before, this is the time to define a composite structure for the capsule. </p> <p>A composite structure is created by decomposing a capsule using capsule parts. A capsule part (or, for simplicity, just part) is typed by another capsule and is a way for a capsule to delegate some of its responsibilities to other capsules. Such a decomposition is purely an implementation detail that is not visible from the outside of the capsule. When you send an event to a capsule you cannot know if the capsule will handle the event itself, or if it will forward the event to another capsule typing one of its capsule parts. The ability to decompose a capsule into parts is important for managing complexity. When a capsule has grown too big and complex you can decompose it into capsule parts without changing the communication interface of the capsule. </p> <p>Ports of capsules typing capsule parts are connected to each other by means of connectors. A connector is a conceptual construct for showing how events are routed in the composite structure of a capsule. At run-time connectors don't exist, and ports are directly connected to each other. Because of this, it's not mandatory to use connectors. You can also choose to dynamically connect (and disconnect) ports at run-time. Although this provides for more flexibility, it has the drawback of making it impossible to statically visualize the communication paths of a capsule. Ports that connect statically to other ports via connectors are called wired ports. Ports that are connected dynamically without use of static connectors are called unwired ports. </p> <p>The picture below shows the structure of a capsule <code>Top</code> which consists of two capsule parts <code>ping</code> and <code>pong</code> each holding a capsule instance (a <code>Pinger</code> capsule and a <code>Ponger</code> capsule respectively). The connector between the wired ports <code>p</code> on these capsules makes it possible for these capsules to communicate with each other. Communication can also happen using the unwired ports <code>q1</code> and <code>q2</code> if they are connected at run-time. The picture also shows that the capsule <code>Ponger</code> is further decomposed using a capsule part <code>inner</code>. All events sent to port <code>p</code> of <code>Ponger</code> will be further routed to port <code>i</code> of the <code>Internal</code> capsule. </p> <p></p> <p>Regardless if ports are statically connected by connectors (wired ports), or dynamically connected at run-time (unwired ports), they must be compatible with each other. This means that the out-events of one port must match the in-events of the other port, for the ports to be possible to connect. This constraint ensures that events are never lost when traveling between two connected ports. To make it possible to describe the events that may be sent between two connected ports using a single protocol, one of the ports can be declared as conjugated. For a conjugated port the meaning of in-events and out-events are swapped, so that the in-events are the events that may be sent out through the port, and the out-events are the ports that may be sent to the port. In the picture above port <code>q1</code> is non-conjugated () while port <code>q2</code> is conjugated ().</p> <p>Both capsule parts and ports may have multiplicity. You can think about a capsule part with multiplicity &gt; 1 as an array that holds capsule instances at run-time. In the same way you can think about a port with multiplicity &gt; 1 as an array that holds connections to port instances at run-time. The multiplicity of ports and parts must match when connecting two ports with each other. Once again, this constraint ensures that events will not be lost when traveling between the connected ports at run-time. The picture below shows a capsule with a part and a port that both have multiplicity &gt; 1. In structure diagrams such parts and ports are shown as \"stacked boxes\".</p> <p></p> <p>In addition to regular C++ member functions a capsule may have a state machine as its behavior. A state machine describes how an instance of the capsule may move between different states through its life-time. A transition that connects a source state with a target state may be triggered when a received event from a capsule's event queue is dispatched. Several conditions must hold true for the transition to trigger. For example, the event must match a trigger that specifies the expected type of event and the port on which it was received. It's also possible to associate a boolean guard condition with the transition and/or with the trigger which must be true for the transition to trigger. A transition may have an effect, which is a piece of C++ code that executes when the transition gets triggered.</p> <p>The picture below shows a state machine containing a few states and transitions. The presence of transition guard code is shown with a yellow dot and the presence of transition effect code is shown with a blue dot. Both these are C++ code snippets that are embedded in the Art file.   </p> <p></p> <p>When a capsule instance is created (this is sometimes referred to as capsule incarnation), it's state machine starts to execute by triggering the transition that goes out from the initial state (the circular blue symbol to the left in the above diagram). Each state machine must have exactly one such initial state with an outgoing transition. Since this initial transition is triggered automatically when the capsule instance is created it cannot have constraints such as triggers and guard conditions. The initial transition is an example of a non-triggered transition since it cannot have triggers. </p> <p>The path from the source state to the target state can sometimes consist of more than one transition. In that case only the first of these is a triggered transition that may have triggers that specify when it will trigger. Once the first transition in this path has triggered, subsequent non-triggered transitions will always execute, one by one according to how they are connected in the state machine. However, also non-triggered transitions (with the exception of the initial transition) may have guards. Such guards are usually evaluated before the triggered transition triggers to ensure that they all are enabled, so that it's guaranteed that the target state can be reached. There is one exception to this rule, for transitions that leave a choice. Such guards are only evaluated once the choice has been reached to dynamically decide which outgoing transition to take next. This also means that guards of such transitions must be written so that at least (and at most) one outgoing transition is enabled, or there is a risk that the state machine will get stuck in the choice.</p> <p>In the state machine shown below the transitions <code>t2</code> and <code>t5</code> are triggered transitions, while other transitions are non-triggered. Transition <code>t5</code> can only be triggered if either the guard of <code>t7</code> or <code>t6</code> is true, while <code>t2</code> can be triggered even if neither the guard of <code>t3</code> nor <code>t4</code> is true. The target of transition <code>t5</code> is a junction which is used for either splitting or merging transition paths depending on evaluated guard conditions.</p> <p></p> <p>A state may be decomposed by a sub state machine. Such a state is called a composite state and a state machine that has composite states is called a hierarchical state machine. Transitions enter a composite state through an entry point and exit it through an exit point. </p> <p>Usually an entry point is connected to a nested state inside the state machine of the composite state, but it can also connect to a deep history. Reaching the deep history of a composite state means that all sub states that were previously active will become active again. Hence, deep history is a way to restore a composite state so all its nested states will be reactivated again recursively.</p> <p>The picture below shows a state machine with a composite state <code>Composite</code> containing two nested states <code>S1</code> and <code>S2</code>. When this state machine starts to execute state <code>S1</code> first becomes active since <code>Composite</code> is entered using the <code>ep1</code> entry point. Later, when leaving <code>S2</code> through the <code>ex1</code> exit point, state <code>X</code> becomes active. Then when leaving <code>X</code> through the transition that connects to the <code>ep2</code> entry point the state <code>S1</code> once again becomes active since <code>ep2</code> is connected to the deep history. Of course, whenever a nested state is active, the enclosing composite state is also active. At any point in time a state machine has an active state configuration, which consists of the set of currently active states.</p> <p></p> <p>A state may have an entry action and/or exit action which is a C++ code snippet that gets executed whenever the state is entered or exited. Note that state entry actions for nested states also run when those states are entered because of a deep history. In state diagrams the presence of entry and/or exit actions are shown by icons just below the state name. In the state machine shown below state <code>S1</code> has an entry action, state <code>S2</code> has an exit action and state <code>S3</code> has both an entry and an exit action.</p> <p></p> <p>A transition where the source and target state is the same state is called a self-transition. A special kind of self-transition is an internal transition, which is a transition that when triggered doesn't leave the current state. Hence, when an internal transition is triggered the active state configuration remains unchanged, and neither the entry nor exit action of the state gets executed. In the state machine shown below the state has two self-transitions; <code>t</code> which is a regular self-transition (a.k.a. external self-transition) and <code>it</code> which is an internal transition. Since a state may have a large number of internal transitions they are not shown inside the state symbol, but if you select the state symbol you can see them in the Properties view. An icon is shown in the upper right corner of states that contain internal transitions.</p> <p></p> <p>State machines can not only be defined for capsules but also for regular classes. This can be useful if you want a plain passive C++ class to have a state machine. Contrary to a capsule a class may not have ports and doesn't execute in its own context. It's therefore common to associate such a class with a capsule that it can use for sending events through its ports. Transitions of a passive class state machine are triggered by calling trigger operations on the class. Such operations have no code, but just trigger transitions in the class state machine.</p> <p>The realtime application needs to designate one capsule as the top capsule. This is done in the transformation configuration, which is a file containing all the properties used for building the application (e.g. code generator options, compiler settings etc.). There is no language construct in Art for defining a top capsule; any capsule that you define can act as the top capsule. However, in practise you typically decide at an early stage which capsule that will be the top capsule.</p> <p>The top capsule is the entry point of the realtime application. When it starts to execute one instance of the top capsule will be automatically created, and its state machine starts to execute.

The non-behavior port <code>p2</code> is a so called relay port (it just relays all events it receives to another port) and the connector between <code>p2</code> and <code>i</code> is sometimes called a delegation connector to describe the fact that capsule <code>Ponger</code> uses it for delegating some of its responsiblities to the capsule <code>Internal</code>.

At run-time this will lead to a local binding between these ports. This enables the capsule to send events to itself which sometimes can be useful.

By sending an event to itself after completion of each small task, the capsule can remain responsive to other events that may arrive in the meantime.

A part is a container that at run-time may hold one or many capsule instances. The part has a multiplicity that specifies the maximum number of capsule instances it can contain at run-time, and it has a type which is another capsule. All capsule instances must either be of that specific capsule type, or of a capsule type that inherits from it.</p> <p>It's common to name parts according to the capsule that types them. For example, a part typed by a capsule <code>Controller</code> may be called <code>controller</code>, <code>ctrl</code> or perhaps <code>theController</code>. By convention part names start with lowercase and use camelCase if the name consists of multiple words. </p> <p>There are three kinds of parts which determine how and when they will be populated with capsule instances.</p> <p>1) Fixed part</p> <p>In a fixed part capsule instances are created automatically when the container capsule is created, and destroyed when the container is destroyed. Fixed parts by default have multiplicity 1. Such a part will always contain one and only one instance of the capsule that types the part.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>You can find a sample application that has a fixed part with a multiplicity here.</p> <p>2) Optional part</p> <p>In an optional part capsule instances don't have a strong lifetime relationship with the container capsule as is the case for fixed parts. The capsule instances can be created programmatically using a Frame port at some point after the container capsule has been created, and they can be destroyed before the container capsule is destroyed. However, at the latest they will be automatically destroyed when the container is destroyed. Optional parts by default have multiplicity 0..1. This means that they may either contain zero or one capsule instance at any point in time. The presence of zero in the multiplicity is what makes the part optional. Here is C++ code for creating a capsule instance in an optional part (also known as incarnating the part) and then immediately destroying it:</p> <pre><code>RTActorId id = frame.incarnate(thePart);\nif (!id.isValid()) {\n    // Failed to incarnate thePart\n}\nframe.destroy(id);\n</code></pre> <p>It's important to check that incarnation was successful since there are many reasons why it can fail (e.g. too low multiplicity to fit the created capsule instance, not enough memory etc). </p> <p>If the instantiated capsule has a constructor you need to use a capsule factory for providing the constructor arguments (either provided when doing the incarnation as shown here or specified on the part as described here).</p> <p>Example</p> <p>You can find a sample application that creates and destroys capsule instances in optional parts here.</p> <p>3) Plugin part</p> <p>A plugin part is similar to an optional part in that it is populated by capsule instances programmatically. However, the capsule instances are not created in the plugin part but instead imported into the plugin part from another part. Typically such a capsule instance is first created into an optional part, and then at some later point in time imported into a plugin part. Later it can be deported (i.e. removed) from the plugin part and perhaps imported into another plugin part. This makes it possible to create very dynamic composite structures where the same capsule instance can play different roles in different parts over time. Moving a capsule instance by deporting it from one plugin part and then importing it in another plugin part is more efficient than destroying the capsule instance in one optional part and then creating another capsule instance in another optional part. Plugin parts are typically used together with unwired ports. In general it's possible to import a capsule instance into more than one plugin part at the same time, but it can only be imported if its ports are not already bound in its current location. Plugin parts by default have multiplicity 0..1.</p> <p>In the example below the capsule <code>C</code> contains a few parts of different kinds and multiplicities. Note that you may declare multiple parts on the same line if they are of the same kind (both <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> below are optional parts).</p> <pre><code>capsule C {\n    part a : D;\n    fixed part b : D[4];\n    optional part c : D, d : D[0..5];\n    plugin part e : D;\n    part f : D[`COUNT`];\n\n    // ...\n};\n</code></pre> <p>Part <code>a</code> is fixed with multiplicity 1 since neither kind nor multiplicity is specified for it. Part <code>b</code> is also fixed (using the <code>fixed</code> keyword for more clarity) and with multiplicity 4. When an instance of capsule <code>C</code> is created 5 instances of capsule <code>D</code> will be automatically created. One of these instances will be inserted into part <code>a</code> and the others into part <code>b</code>. These instances will remain there until the <code>C</code> capsule instance is destroyed.</p> <p>Part <code>c</code> is optional with multiplicity 0..1. At run-time it can contain at most one instance of capsule <code>D</code>. Part <code>d</code> is also optional but can contain up to 5 instances of <code>D</code> as specified by its multiplicity 0..5.</p> <p>Part <code>e</code> is plugin with the default multiplicity 0..1. At run-time at most one instance of capsule <code>D</code> can be imported into it. That instance must already have been created in another part, for example part <code>c</code>.</p> <p>Part <code>f</code> uses a C++ expression for specifying the multiplicity. This can for example be useful if the multiplicity is defined in C++ as a macro, a template parameter or a constexpr.</p> <p>Parts can be shown in a structure diagram:</p> <p></p> <p>Parts are shown as \"stacked\" if they have non-single multiplicity (multiplicities specified with a C++ expression are assumed to be non-single). Optional parts are shown with a \"diagonal\" background pattern, while plugin parts are shown with a \"double diagonal\" background pattern.</p> <p>Parts can also be shown in a class diagram:</p> <p></p> <p>In the above diagram the filled diamonds show that there is a strong life-time relationship between a <code>C</code> instance and the instances of <code>D</code> that are located in the fixed and optional parts <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>d</code> and <code>f</code>, while this is not the case for the instance located in the plugin part <code>e</code> as shown by the hollow diamond.</p>"},{"location":"art-lang/#part-with-capsule-factory","title":"Part with Capsule Factory","text":"<p>If the capsule that types a part has a capsule constructor with custom constructor parameters, you can define a capsule factory for the part.

A trigger operation is similar to a regular member function in C++, but does not have a code behavior of its own. Instead, when you call a trigger operation on an object of a class with a state machine it may trigger a transition in the class' state machine.

This means that the capsule instance is responsible both for creating, using and finally destroying the class-with-statemachine instance. If you follow this pattern it is thread-safe to for example call public member functions defined on the capsule from a transition in the class state machine (or, better, to call non-public member functions by letting the class be a friend of the capsule). This can for example be used as a means for the class state machine to send events through the ports of the capsule (i.e. it can call a capsule member function that sends the event). However, to avoid exposing the full capsule functionality to the class state machine it's recommended to define an interface (i.e. abstract C++ class) which the capsule can implement.

This makes it possible to redefine transitions and states.

The implementation of that function (also placed in the <code>rt::impl</code> code snippet) calls the inherited function by using a macro <code>SUPER</code>.

This is yet another reason why it's good practise to give names to transitions, even if it's not mandated. But, of course, if you want to prevent anyone from creating a derived capsule with a state machine that redefines a certain transition, you can accomplish that by not giving a name to that transition. In effect, an unnamed transition is final, i.e. cannot be overridden or excluded.</p> <p>The rule that a capsule state machine must have exactly one initial transition also applies to a derived capsule. Therefore, when you introduce inheritance between two existing capsules, you typically first get an error saying that the derived capsule has two initial transitions (one inherited, and one locally defined).

Always think about how a type will be used before deciding if it needs a type descriptor or not.</p>"},{"location":"art-lang/cpp-extensions/#c-implementation","title":"C++ Implementation","text":"<p>The C++ implementation of a type descriptor consists of four parts. In the code shown below we assume the type descriptor describes a type called \"MyType\".</p> <p>1) A type descriptor object</p> <p>This is a variable typed by <code>RTObject_class</code> with a name that has the prefix \"RTType_\". It will be declared in the header file:</p> <pre><code>extern const RTObject_class RTType_MyType;\n</code></pre> <p>and implemented in the implementation file:</p> <pre><code>const RTObject_class RTType_MyType =\n{\n    // Initialization of RTObject_class corresponding to properties of MyType\n};\n</code></pre> <p>Member variables of RTObject_class store all information about the type, such as its name and byte size. Some of the member variables store pointers to type descriptor functions which the TargetRTS will call when it needs to do something with an instance of the type, for example copy or encode it.</p> <p>2) Type descriptor functions</p> <p>These are functions with a certain prototype, each of which performs a specific action on an instance of the type. The type descriptor object stores pointers to these functions. For a partial type descriptor, some of these pointers will be <code>nullptr</code> and then the corresponding type descriptor function does not exist. Below is the list of type descriptor functions that can be part of a type descriptor:</p> <p></p> Name Prototype Purpose init <code>void rtg_MyType_init(const RTObject_class* type, MyType* target)</code> Initializes an instance of the type copy <code>void rtg_MyType_copy(const RTObject_class* type, MyType* target, const MyType* source)</code> Copies one instance of the type (source) to another (target) move <code>void rtg_MyType_move(const RTObject_class* type, MyType* target, MyType* source)</code> Moves one instance of the type (source) to another (target) destroy <code>void rtg_MyType_destroy(const RTObject_class* type, MyType* target)</code> Destroys an instance of the type encode <code>void rtg_MyType_encode(const RTObject_class* type, const MyType* source, RTEncoding* coding)</code> Encodes an instance of the type decode <code>void rtg_MyType_decode(const RTObject_class* type, MyType* target, RTDecoding* coding)</code> Decodes an instance of the type <p>The encode function usually encodes the instance into a string representation, and the decode function usually parses the same string representation and creates an instance of the type from it. However, the functions use interface classes <code>RTEncoding</code> and <code>RTDecoding</code> from the TargetRTS which can be implemented in many different ways. Note also that you can globally disable the support for encoding and/or decoding by unsetting the macros <code>OBJECT_ENCODE</code> and <code>OBJECT_DECODE</code> respectively. Learn more about encoding and decoding in this chapter.</p> <p>3) A type installer object</p> <p>Decoding functions typically need to look up a type descriptor from the name of the type. For example, if it finds the type name \"MyType\" in the string that it parses, it needs to find the type descriptor object for \"MyType\" so it can allocate memory for an instance of \"MyType\" and then initialize it. To facilitate this lookup the TargetRTS keeps a type descriptor registry. The purpose of the type installer object is to add the type descriptor to this registry. The C++ code looks like this:</p> <pre><code>#if OBJECT_DECODE\nRTTypeInstaller rtg_MyType_installer( RTType_MyType );\n#endif\n</code></pre> <p>4) A \"typed value\" struct</p> <p>This is a struct which encapsulates an untyped instance of the type and its type descriptor. Its name has the prefix \"RTTypedValue_\". The struct has constructors that enable construction from a reference to an instance of the type. The typed value struct is the glue between generated code and TargetRTS code. TargetRTS functions get an untyped instance together with the type descriptor, and the type descriptor provides all information it needs to know about the type.</p> <p>The typed value struct will be declared and implemented in the header file:</p> <pre><code>struct RTTypedValue_MyType\n{\n    const void * data; // Untyped pointer to an instance of MyType\n    const RTObject_class * type; // Type descriptor for MyType\n    const bool rValueRef = false; // Was the typed value struct created from an rvalue or lvalue reference to MyType?\n    inline RTTypedValue_MyType( const MyType &amp; rtg_value )\n        : data( &amp;rtg_value )\n        , type( &amp;RTType_MyType )\n    {\n    }\n    inline RTTypedValue_MyType( const MyType &amp;&amp; rtg_value )\n        : data( &amp;rtg_value )\n        , type( &amp;RTType_Colors )\n        , rValueRef( true )\n    {\n    }\n    inline RTTypedValue_MyType( const MyType &amp; rtg_value, const RTObject_class * rtg_type )\n        : data( &amp;rtg_value )\n        , type( rtg_type )\n    {\n    }\n    inline RTTypedValue_MyType( const MyType &amp;&amp; rtg_value, const RTObject_class * rtg_type )\n        : data( &amp;rtg_value )\n        , type( rtg_type )\n        , rValueRef( true )\n    {\n    }\n    inline ~RTTypedValue_MyType( void )\n    {\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"art-lang/cpp-extensions/#automatically-generated","title":"Automatically Generated","text":"<p>The code generator will automatically generate a type descriptor for a type if you mark it with the rt::auto_descriptor attribute.

For example, when editing the effect code of a transition it can be useful to look at that transition in its state machine (either in the Art file or in a state diagram). You can Ctrl-click the hyperlink of the USR-comment to perform this navigation as shown in the picture below.</p> <p></p> <p>You can make edits in multiple code snippets in a generated file.

This opens up for dynamic TC properties where the value of a property is computed at build-time. For simple cases it may be enough to replace static values for TC properties with JavaScript expressions to be able to build several variants of an application. As an example, assume that you want to either build a release or a debug version of an application. The debug version is obtained by compiling the code with the <code>$(DEBUG_TAG)</code> flag. The TC can then for example look like this:</p> <pre><code>let tc = TCF.define(TCF.CPP_TRANSFORM);\ntc.topCapsule = 'Top';\nlet system = Java.type('java.lang.System');\nlet isDebug = system.getenv('DEBUG_BUILD');\ntc.compileArguments = isDebug ?

Setting up several environment variables in a consistent fashion will require effort for everyone that needs to build the application, and perhaps you even need to write a script to manage it.

It defines a number of high-level settings, we call them build variant settings, each of which is implemented by a separate JavaScript file.

The \"debug\" flag we implemented in the example above is an example of a boolean setting.</li> <li>Enumerated settings These are settings that can have a fixed set of values. A list of supported target platforms could be an example of an enumerated setting.</li> </ol> <p>A Build Variants script must have a global function called <code>initBuildVariants</code> which defines the build variant settings. Here is an example where one boolean and one enumerated build variant setting are defined:</p> <pre><code>// Boolean setting\nlet isDebug = {\n    name: 'Debug',\n    script: 'debug.js',\n    defaultValue: false,\n    description: 'If set, a debug version of the application will be built'\n};\n\n// Enumerated setting\nlet optimization = {\n    name: 'Optimization',\n    alternatives: [\n      { name: 'HIGH',  script: 'opt.js', args: ['HIGH'],  description: 'Apply all optimizations', defaultValue: true },\n      { name: 'MEDIUM',  script: 'opt.js', args: ['MEDIUM'],  description: 'Apply some optimizations'},\n      { name: 'OFF', script: 'opt.js', args: ['OFF'], description: 'Turn off all optimizations' }\n    ]\n};\n\n// This function defines which build variant settings that are applicable for a certain TC\nfunction initBuildVariants(tc) {\n    BVF.add(isDebug);\n    BVF.add(optimization);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note the following:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>name</code> property specifies a user-friendly name of the build variant setting.</li> <li>Use the <code>description</code> property to document what the build variant setting means and how it works.</li> <li>In case of an enumerated setting, exactly one of the alternatives should have the <code>defaultValue</code> property set. This alternative will be used in case no value is provided for that build variant setting at build-time. For a boolean setting, <code>defaultValue</code> should be set to either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> depending on if you want the build setting to be turned on or off by default.</li> <li>The <code>script</code> property specifies the JavaScript file that implements the build variant setting. The path is relative to the location of the Build Variants script (usually they are all placed in the same folder). For a boolean setting the script is only invoked if the setting is set to <code>true</code>. For an enumerated setting the script is always invoked, and the value of the enumerated setting is passed as an argument to the script using the <code>args</code> property. It's therefore possible (and common) to implement all alternatives of an enumerated setting with the same script.</li> </ul> <p>The <code>initBuildVariants</code> function gets the built TC as an argument. You can use it for defining different build variant settings for different kinds of TCs.

Therefore you cannot access the TC in this function. The only input to the function is the script arguments, as defined by the <code>args</code> property for an enumerated setting. The main reason for implementing a <code>preProcess</code> function is to compute some data based on a build variant setting. Such data can be stored globally and later be accessed when <code>postProcess</code> gets called or in a TC file when setting the value of a TC property. Here is an example:</p> <pre><code>function preProcess( targetPlatform ) {\n    MSG.formatInfo(\"Building for target platform %s\", targetPlatform);\n    TCF.globals().targetPlatform = targetPlatform;\n    if (targetPlatform == 'Win64_MSVS') {\n        TCF.globals().targetCompiler = 'MSVS';\n        MSG.formatInfo(\"Building with Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler\");       \n    } else {\n        TCF.globals().targetCompiler = 'GCC';       \n        MSG.formatInfo(\"Building with GNU Compiler\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Here we use the <code>MSG</code> object for printing messages to the build log and we use the <code>TCF</code> object for storing globally some data that we have computed based on the build variant setting.

The function gets the built TC as an argument, as well as all its prerequisite TCs. For an enumerated setting it also gets the script arguments as defined by the <code>args</code> property. The function can directly modify properties of both the built TC and all its prerequisites. The property values that the TCs have when the function returns are the ones that will be used in the build. Hence this function gives you full freedom to customize all TC properties so that they have values suitable for the build variant setting. Here is an example that uses the global data computed in the <code>preProcess</code> function above:</p> <pre><code>function postProcess(topTC, allTCs, targetPlatform) {   \n    for (i = 0; i &lt; allTCs.length; ++i) {\n      if (TCF.globals().targetCompiler == 'MSVS') {\n        allTCs[i].compileCommand = 'cl';\n      }\n      else if (TCF.globals().targetCompiler == 'GCC') {\n        allTCs[i].compileCommand = 'gcc';\n      }       \n    }\n    if (targetPlatform == 'MacOS') {\n        MSG.formatWarning(\"MacOS builds are not fully supported yet\");    \n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Also in this function we can use the <code>TCF</code> and <code>MSG</code> objects to access global data and to print messages to the build log. But most importantly, we can directly write the properties of the <code>topTC</code> (the TC that is built) and/or <code>allTCs</code> (the TC that is built followed by all its prerequisite TCs). </p> <p>By modifying the compileArguments TC property the build variant setting script can set preprocessor macros in order to customize the code that gets compiled. Hence we can both customize how the application is built, and also what it will do at run-time.

It shows how dependency injection can be used together with build variants to build different versions of an application, where capsules behave differently.</li> <li>The validation rule ART_0018_circularTransitions has been improved so it now also can detect transition cycles caused by incorrect usage of entry/exit points, or cycles introduced because of state machine inheritance.</li> <li>You can now invoke Content Assist within a C++ code snippet in an Art file, and get the same result as if you would invoke it from the generated C++ code. This significantly increases the productivity when working with C++ in Art files, and reduces the need to navigate to generated code for typing C++ code. This feature works both for the \"Microsoft C++\" and \"clangd\" language servers, but with small differences due to the way they are implemented. Common is that the feature may sometimes need to be invoked twice, before it starts to work, when an Art file has been opened for the first time (or the first time in a while).</li> <li>The TargetRTS now includes a JSON parser, which makes it easier to consume or expose JSON-based APIs from your realtime application. For more information see JSON Parser.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now analyzes <code>rt::decl</code> code snippets of a capsule, looking for user-defined constructors. If at least one user-defined constructor is present, it doesn't generate the default capsule constructor it otherwise generates. Other parts of generated code were updated accordingly to no longer assume that a capsule has a default constructor. For an example, see this sample.</li> <li>You can now open Art and TC files specified in the <code>sources</code> and <code>prerequisites</code> TC properties by means of hyperlinks in the TC editor. When specified paths can be resolved to valid Art or TC files, they will become underlined, and can be opened by Ctrl+click.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"releases/CHANGELOG/#101-2024-02-08-0840","title":"1.0.1 (2024-02-08 08:40)","text":"<ol> <li>A new sample QtTrafficLight is now available. It shows how to integrate the code generated from Code RealTime with a user interface developed with Qt. Note that the Qt part of the sample application is found in another Git repository.</li> <li>A new validation rule ART_0036_unexpectedTriggers detects if a transition that is supposed to be non-triggered still has at least one trigger. A Quick Fix can then be used for removing the unexpected triggers. </li> <li>A new validation rule ART_0037_missingTriggers detects if a transition that is supposed to be triggered doesn't have any triggers.</li> <li>The showing of validation problems in diagrams was improved to be more accurate, for example when expanding or collapsing a composite state. Also, a derived capsule state machine that has an inherited transition that is incorrect in the context of the derived state machine will now cause an error to be shown for the inherited transition in a state diagram for the derived capsule.</li> <li>The predefined variable <code>${workspaceFolder}</code> can now be used when specifying the prerequisites of a TC. This is often a better alternative than using a relative path since it allows the prerequisite TC to be located anywhere in the file system and still be found when resolving the prerequisite. As an example you can write <code>${workspaceFolder:MyLibrary}/lib.tcjs</code> where <code>MyLibrary</code> is the name of the workspace folder where the prerequisite TC is located.</li> <li>The Art Compiler now has a new option <code>-ws</code> which can be used for specifying the location of the workspace (in the form of a <code>.code-workspace</code> file). It's optional to use this option, but it must be specified if built TCs contain workspace-relative paths.</li> <li>The validation rule ART_0002_duplicateNamesInScope was improved to find naming conflicts caused by inheritance.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now supports global capsule factories by means of a new TC property <code>capsuleFactory</code>. This allows to globally control how capsule instances in an application are created and destroyed. One scenario where this is useful is when using the <code>RTInjector</code> class from the TargetRTS to implement dependency injection for capsule creation. For an example, see this sample. Read more about these topics in new documentation chapters Capsule Factory and Dependency Injection.</li> <li>The Art Compiler now sorts reported messages according to their file position. This means that messages, such as errors and warnings, now are reported in the same order when building from the command-line as when building from the UI.</li> <li>The TargetRTS now has support for decoding a JSON string into an object (already before it had support for the opposite, i.e. encoding an object into JSON). This is useful when implementing applications that exchange JSON, for example with a web service or some other API. It can also be used for persisting application data in files or object databases. For an example, see this sample.</li> <li>Rename refactorings have been improved to also update references in <code>art_diagram_settings.json</code>.</li> <li>The TargetRTS documentation has been extended. For example, it now covers how to build, debug and customize the TargetRTS.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"releases/CHANGELOG/#100-2023-12-11-0833","title":"1.0.0 (2023-12-11 08:33)","text":"<ol> <li>The product is now renamed to DevOps Code RealTime and in addition to the Community Edition a Commercial Edition is also available. With the Commercial Edition comes support entitlement, the right to use the product and generated applications for commercial purposes, and access to the TargetRTS source files which makes it possible to build applications for any target platform.</li> <li>The Clang language server clangd is now supported. It is available both for Visual Studio Code and Eclipse Theia.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now supports \"receive-any\" events, i.e. the use of an asterisk for specifying a trigger that handles any event received on a port. For an example, see this sample.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now supports unwired ports. For an example, see this sample.</li> <li>When a TC property that contains a list of values, for example the <code>sources</code> property, is modified in the form-based TC editor, the TC file is automatically updated accordingly. Now the formatting of such TC properties is improved by placing each list element on a line of its own, and to add a trailing comma after the last element. This makes it easier to merge the TC file, without getting merge conflicts, in case more people are editing it in parallel.</li> <li>Diagram settings (stored in the file <code>art_diagram_settings.json</code>) now uses an improved JSON format. A benefit with this new format is that it's now possible to move a workspace folder in the file system without invalidating the diagram settings. Another benefit is that each capsule part in a structure diagram can now be independently expanded, even for the case when there are multiple capsule parts typed by the same capsule.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now supports classes with state machines.

Such unreachable transitions are now reported as a problem (with warning severity as default). A comment is also added in generated code to mark the unreachable code where functions of such unreachable transitions are called.</li> <li>Several new validation rules now check the correctness of the <code>threads</code> property in a TC. For example, an attempt to map the same logical thread to different physical threads are reported as a problem. Previously, such problems were only detected when compiling or linking the application, or even at run-time.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now supports the deep history pseudostate (<code>history*</code>). For an example, see this sample.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now supports the <code>const_rtdata</code> property. By setting this property to <code>false</code> on a transition, the <code>rtdata</code> parameter of the transition function will be non-const. This, for example, allows it to be moved instead of copied, which can be more efficient. For an example, see this sample.</li> <li>The validation rule ART_0001_invalidNameCpp has been extended to now also detect if names chosen for Art elements will clash with names in generated code or the TargetRTS.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now supports excluded transitions. For an example, see this sample.</li> <li>It's now possible to delete ports and parts from a structure diagram by selecting them and then pressing the <code>Delete</code> key or using the Delete command in the popup menu that appears when pressing Ctrl+Space.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now supports junctions and the guards on their outgoing transitions. For an example, see this sample.</li> <li>A new validation rule CPP_4002_guardedInitialTransition now detects if there are junctions in the initial transition without unguarded outgoing transitions. With such initial transitions there is a risk that no initial state will be entered, which would break the functioning of the state machine.</li> <li>A new command \"Deactivate All\" in the Art Build view can be used for quickly making all TCs in the workspace non-active. This makes it faster to switch from building one set of active TCs to another.</li> <li>Several validation rules have been updated to mark problems more accurately in an Art file. If an element spans multiple lines in the Art file (e.g. a capsule or state machine) then if the whole element would be marked, problems within the element cannot be seen in the Art file. Now smaller parts of such elements are marked such as only the element name or a certain keyword within the element. In addition to a cleaner look this also makes navigation from problems arrive closer to where the problem is located.</li> <li>The TC property \"userLibraries\" is now supported (both in TC editor and UI). It can be used for specifying a list of libraries to pass to the linker.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now supports capsule factories on parts by means of the <code>rt::create</code> and <code>rt::destroy</code> code snippets. For an example, see this sample.</li> <li>The TargetRTS and C++ code generator now supports the predefined type <code>long long</code>.</li> <li>A target configuration for the Clang compiler for MacOs is now provided.</li> <li>The Art Compiler now prints related elements for validation problems. This means that you now get the same amount of details about a validation problem when building from command-line as from the UI.</li> <li>When building from the UI, TCs are now validated and found problems are reported in the Art Build output channel. Any error found during this validation will stop the build. Previously such errors were only reported when building from the command-line, and the UI build would proceed even in case errors were found, which often lead to other problems later in the build process.</li> <li>The TC property \"userObjectFiles\" is now supported (both in TC editor and UI). It can be used for specifying a list of object files to pass to the linker.</li> <li>The TC property \"inclusionPaths\" is now supported (both in TC editor and UI).

When you declare a type in an <code>rt::decl</code> code snippet you can tag it with a C++ attribute to tell the code generator how it should generate the type descriptor. Currently two attributes are supported: <code>rt::auto_descriptor</code> (for fully automatic type descriptor generation) and <code>rt::manual_descriptor</code> (when you prefer to write the type descriptor manually). Read more about this feature in the documentation.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now supports local bindings (i.e. a connector between two behavior ports on the same capsule). This makes it possible for a capsule to send events to itself. Read more about this feature here.</li> <li>The support for state machine inheritance in the C++ code generator has been much improved. For an example, see this sample.</li> <li>Two new validation rules were implemented for checks related to ports. See ART_0034_servicePortWithoutEvents and ART_0035_timerServicePort.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now performs additional validation of an Art file when it's translated to C++. Dedicated validation rules are used for this purpose and they can be enabled/disabled and have their severity customized in the same way as other validation rules. Found problems appear in the Art file, in the Problems view and in diagrams. For more information see the documentation.</li> <li>You can now use colors on most symbols and lines also in class and structure diagrams.</li> <li>Use of certain colors have been improved to ensure that diagrams remain readable when custom symbol colors are used. For example, background patterns printed on optional and plugin parts in structure diagrams now use a light color if the background color is dark, and a dark color if the background color is light.</li> <li>Navigation from code snippets in generated C++ files to the source Art files is now supported. The file URIs in the USR-comments surrounding the code snippets can now be ctrl-clicked in order to perform the navigation.</li> <li>Structure diagrams can now be edited. You can create ports and parts, and also use the Properties view for viewing and editing some of the properties of these elements.</li> <li>A new \"Art Build\" view is now available. It shows all TCs in the workspace and for each TC its prerequisites are shown as a tree structure. Common commands are available on the TCs, such as Clean, Build and Run. A TC that is often built can be selected in the \"Art Build\" view, so that it's not necessary to find it in the Explorer view each time it should be built. The new view also provides a button for invoking the \"Clean All\" command that previously only could be invoked through the Command Palette.</li> <li>It's now possible to specify physical and logical threads in a TC. The C++ code generator uses this information for creating those physical threads and application code can reference the logical threads when a capsule instance is created. For more information see the documentation. Note that currently thread information can only be specified in the TC text editor (the form-based editor doesn't yet support it).</li> <li>Validation markers for showing problems in diagrams are now also supported on labels within class diagram symbols. Hence, it's now possible to see validation problems on ports, parts and events.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"releases/CHANGELOG/#009-2023-07-20-0739","title":"0.0.9 (2023-07-20 07:39)","text":"<ol> <li>It's now possible to build multiple variants of an application by means of a feature called Build Variants. You can use JavaScript for dynamically customizing a TC at build-time, in order to implement high-level build variant settings. Build variants are implemented in the Art Compiler by means of two new options: <code>--buildConfig</code> and <code>--buildVariants</code>. For an example, see this sample.</li> <li>A new command \"Clean All\" is now available. It will remove all generated code in the workspace and also remove all generated workspace folders. It's equivalent to, but more convenient than, invoking the \"Clean\" command on each TC individually. Invoke \"Clean All\" from the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).</li> <li>The C++ code generator now supports multiple inheritance for capsules. A capsule can at most inherit one other capsule, but now it's in addition also possible to inherit any number of C++ types. For an example, see this sample.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now assigns the correct type for the <code>rtdata</code> parameter in transition functions generated for non-triggered transitions. Previously this only worked for triggered transitions, and <code>rtdata</code> in a non-triggered transition would become untyped (const void *). Now the code generator analyzes the whole transition chain to use the more specific type also for functions generated for non-triggered transitions. For an example, see this sample.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now supports specifying a guard condition either using a C++ boolean expression, or a C++ return statement that returns a boolean expression. In the former case the code generator will automatically add the return keyword in generated code. Code-to-art synchronization also handles both these cases. </li> <li>When a TC is built from the UI using the context menu command Build (or Run on a TC that was not built already), the Problems view is now scanned to check if it contains at least one error related to the built TC, or a prerequisite TC. If so, a dialog will appear to ask if you really want to proceed with the build. It's recommended to cancel the build, fix the error, and then redo the build. If you choose to proceed with the build you may get either build or run-time errors in the built application. A new setting <code>rtistic.build.cancelOnError</code> can be used to control this behavior.</li> <li>Redefined elements are now drawn in diagrams with a different line style (\"dashed-dot-dot\"), to make them easier to distinguish from inherited elements (that are still drawn with a dashed line style). Labels for redefined elements are still drawn with green color to further emphasize the difference between a redefined and an inherited element in diagrams.</li> <li>RTist in Code is now available as a Docker image on DockerHub. You can deploy this image to get the latest version of RTist in Code running in Eclipse Theia.</li> <li>The presence of elements in the global scope with clashing names is now detected across the whole workspace. All source files that will be built by the active TC are checked. Previously such problems were not detected until linking the built application.</li> <li>Launch configurations are now supported for running an application built by a TC. This is a more flexible way to launch applications than using the Run context menu of a TC. You can set environment variables and command-line arguments for the launched application, as well as its current working directory. You can also easily terminate and relaunch the application using the launch toolbar.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now supports compound transitions. Each individual transition of the compound transition is translated to a separate C++ function to avoid code duplication. Also, for increased code readability the numbers representing states are now followed by the state name in a comment. For an example, see this sample.</li> <li>A new sample PiComputer is now available. It contains a few collaborating capsules with hierarchical state machines and implements a computation of Pi.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now supports choices.

This new setting hence plays the same role for a UI build as the --out option does when building with the Art Compiler from the command-line.</li> <li>Several small sample applications are now available in the RTist in Code GitHub Repo. These are written as tests of the Art Compiler and the TargetRTS, but can also be useful for learning more about the Art language and RTist in Code.</li> <li>TC prerequisites are now taken into account when generating the <code>c_cpp_properties.json</code> file. This prevents references to definitions in prerequisite libraries to appear as broken in the UI when looking at generated code, and it also enables features such as Content Assist, hover tooltips etc for those definitions.</li> <li>TC prerequisites and the \"sources\" TC property are now taken into account when binding references in the UI. It's required to set the TC as active so name lookup can find the correct prerequisites. This means that name binding rules used in the UI now are aligned with how the build works.</li> <li>It's now possible to redirect a transition in a state diagram. Select the transition to redirect and the new source or target element in the diagram. Then use one of the new commands in the Ctrl+Space popup menu: Set Transition Source or Set Transition Target.

The created element is added last in the state machine in the Art file. If a state is selected the popup menu contains commands for creating elements inside the state. If required, it will first be converted to a composite state. You can also create transitions using this popup menu. Select first the source and then the target and then invoke a command for creating the transition.</li> <li>You can now open diagrams for an element by selecting it in a diagram and then open the Ctrl+Space popup menu. For example, if you select a capsule part in a structure diagram, the popup menu contains commands for opening the state, structure or class diagram of the capsule that types the part. Previously it was necessary to first navigate to the capsule part in the Art file, then from there to the capsule, and finally from there the diagram could be opened. Now this navigation can be performed in a single step without involving the Art file at all.</li> <li>State diagram elements can now be deleted by using a new Delete command in the popup menu that appears when pressing Ctrl+Space in a state diagram.</li> <li>It's now possible to remove a color from a symbol or line by selecting it in the state diagram and then press the trashcan icon that appears in the Properties view.</li> <li>When performing a diagram command that modifies the Art file, the cursor is now set at an location in the Art file that corresponds to the changed diagram element. If possible, relevant text is also selected in the Art file. This serves two purposes; it becomes easier to notice the impact of the change in the Art file, and Undo/Redo will work correctly.</li> <li>Transformation configurations are now validated to detect inconsistent and incorrect property values. For example, you will get a warning if you build a library but a TC property is used that only is applicable when building an executable. And you will get an error if a TC property specifies a value of incorrect type. </li> <li>A new TC property, \"sources\", can now be used for controlling which Art files that should be transformed to C++ by the code generator. It is a list of glob-style patterns and anti-patterns. A file will be transformed if it matches at least one pattern (e.g. <code>*.art</code>) and doesn't match any anti-pattern (e.g. <code>!exclude.art</code>). This property is not yet supported by the form-based TC editor, but can be set in the .tcjs file in order to exclude one or several Art files in the workspace folder where the TC is located.</li> <li>The TC editor description tooltips now have a background color that is dynamically adjusted to make it visible regardless of selected color theme.</li> <li>The Art text editor now provides a \"code lens\" for building and running a capsule without first having to create a TC.

For a capsule part that gets incarnated with capsule instances at run-time, examples of such dependencies include which capsule to create an instance of, what data to pass to the capsule constructor, and which thread that should run the created capsule instance. But the behavior of a capsule instance also depends a lot on which other capsule instances it communicates with at run-time, so those are also examples of dependencies.</p> <p>Dependency injection is a technique where run-time dependencies of objects are managed by a central injector object, instead of being hardcoded across the application. The injector is configured so it provides the desired dependencies for objects when they are needed at run-time. One benefit with using dependency injection is that objects in your application become more loosly coupled and it becomes much easier to configure and customize the behavior of your application.</p> <p>There are many dependency injection frameworks for C++ which you can use for the passive C++ classes of your application. To use dependency injection for capsules, the TargetRTS provides a class <code>RTInjector</code>. You can use this class for registering create-functions for capsule parts at application start-up. When the TargetRTS needs to incarnate a capsule part, it will check if a create-function is registered for it. If so, that create-function will be called for creating the capsule instance. Otherwise, the capsule instance will be created by the TargetRTS itself, as usual.</p> <p>To use dependency injection in your realtime application you need to implement a global capsule factory and specify it in your TC. The <code>create()</code> function of the global capsule factory delegates all calls to the <code>RTInjector</code> singleton object.</p> <p>You also must configure the injector by registering create-functions for all capsule parts where you want to customize how a capsule instance should be created. You need to do this early, typically at application start-up. At least it must be done before the TargetRTS attempts to create a capsule instance in a capsule part which you want to customize with dependency injection. A good place can be to do it in the constructor of the top capsule, in the main function of your application, or in the constructor of a static object (such as the global capsule factory object itself).</p> <p>A create-function is registered by calling <code>registerCreateFunction()</code> on <code>RTInjector</code>. The second argument is the create-function, and the first argument is a string that specifies the path to the capsule part in the composite structure of the application. Such paths always start with a <code>/</code> denoting the top capsule, and then follows names of capsules parts separated by <code>/</code>. You can use a <code>:</code> to specify the index of a capsule instance in a part with multiplicity. For example, if the application has this composite structure</p> <p></p> <p>then the path string <code>/logSystem:0/logger</code> refers to the capsule part <code>logger</code> that is contained in the <code>LogSystem</code> capsule instance which is the first (index 0) capsule instance in the capsule part <code>logSystem</code> of the top capsule <code>Top</code>.</p> <p>A call to <code>registerCreateFunction()</code> to customize the incarnation of capsule instances in the <code>logger</code> capsule part could then look like this:</p> <pre><code>RTInjector::getInstance().registerCreateFunction(\"/logSystem:0/logger\",\n    [this](RTController * c, RTActorRef * a, int index) {                       \n        return new TimestampLogger_Actor(c, a);\n    }\n);\n</code></pre> <p>Example</p> <p>You can find a sample application that uses dependency injection here.</p> <p>In most cases your application will only register create-functions once at start-up. However, <code>RTInjector</code> allows to do it at any time, and you can also remove or replace an already registered create-function. This makes it possible to implement very dynamic dependency injection scenarios. For example, you can change which capsule that gets instantiated depending on how much memory is currently available.</p> <p>Dependency injection can for example be useful when implementing capsule unit testing in order to \"mock out\" capsules which the capsule-under-test depends on. In this case you could for example let the registration of create-functions be controlled by a configuration file that is part of the test case.</p> <p>Another possibility is to combine dependency injection with Build Variants to build multiple variants of an application by means of high-level build settings (so called \"build variants\"). The build variant script can set compilation macros that control how injected create-functions behave.</p>"},{"location":"target-rts/encoding-decoding/","title":"Encoding and Decoding","text":"<p>Encoding is the process of serializing data from memory into a string representation. Decoding is the opposite, i.e. deserializing a string representation of data into memory. There are many situations when it's useful to encode and/or decode:</p> <ul> <li>During run-time logging and tracing it can be useful to print a compact representation of data by encoding it into a string.</li> <li>If your application is distributed into several binaries that run in separate processes (or even on separate machines), and you need to send data from one binary to another, then a string representation of the data to send can be useful. The sender can encode the data into a string which for example can be sent over TCP to the receiver. The receiver can then decode the string back into data in its memory space.</li> <li>Even within the same process it can sometimes be useful to clone an object by first encoding it to a string, and then decoding that string back into a copy of the original object. However, in most cases use of copy constructors is a more efficient way of cloning objects.</li> <li>If you need to save data from your application into some form of persistent storage (file, database etc.) you can encode it into a string representation, and then persist that string. Later (possibly in another instance of your application) you can load the saved data by decoding the persisted string back to memory.</li> </ul> <p>The TargetRTS provides support for encoding and decoding data by means of the <code>encode</code> and <code>decode</code> functions of a type descriptor. This means that if you want to use encoding and/or decoding for a data type, you just need to make sure that it has a type descriptor with one or both of these functions implemented. The TargetRTS has a default implementation for encoding and decoding many types, including all predefined C++ types, structured types and enums. You can choose between three string formats:</p> <ul> <li>ASCII This is a format that is intended to be readable both by humans and machines, while still being as compact as possible. It's however a proprietary format that is not understood by other tools.</li> <li>ASCIIV This format is identical to ASCII but in addition it includes the version of the type descriptor. This can be useful if you change the type that gets encoded and need to maintain backwards compatibility. The decoder can then use the version information to know how to decode the encoded string.</li> <li>JSON This is a standardized format that is supported by a large number of tools. There are JSON parsers for most programming languages which makes it a good choice if your application includes components written in other languages than C++. Because of this, it's also a popular format for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications that need to interact with web services or APIs.</li> </ul> <p>If your data type is too complex for the default encode/decode implementation in the TargetRTS, or if you want to use some other format than the above two, you can write your own encode/decode functions.

It can either do this as soon as it has pushed any data on the external port, or wait until a certain number of data objects have been pushed. </p> <p>Here is an example of external code for pushing a data object consisting of a string and an integer on the external port:</p> <pre><code>std::pair&lt;std::string,int&gt;* data = new std::pair&lt;std::string,int&gt;(\"external data\", 15);\nextPort.dataPushBack(data);\n</code></pre> <p>And here is how the capsule can choose to fetch the data in a FIFO manner:</p> <pre><code>unsigned int remaining;\ndo {\n    std::pair&lt;std::string,int&gt;* data;\n    remaining = extPort.dataPopFront((void**) &amp;data);\n    if (data == 0)\n        break;\n    // Handle received external data here...\n    delete data;\n}\nwhile (remaining &gt; 0);\n</code></pre> <p>Note that the external code is responsible for allocating the data pushed on the external port, while the capsule is responsible for deleting the data once it has fetched it. The capsule can choose whether it wants to fetch all available data at once (as in the above example), or only some of it. However, it's important to design the application so that external port data doesn't just keep growing as that eventually would cause the application to run out of memory.</p> <p>It's of course possible to implement another scheme for passing data from external code to a capsule, and the data area of an external port should just be seen as a convenience. Any data structure can be shared between the external code and the capsule, but it's important that it is thread-safe. You can for example use a mutex (see <code>RTMutex</code> in the TargetRTS) for protecting data that is shared by the external thread and the capsule's thread.</p>"},{"location":"target-rts/integrate-with-external-code/#main-function","title":"Main Function","text":"<p>The TargetRTS contains a <code>main()</code> function implementation which is used when you build an executable.
